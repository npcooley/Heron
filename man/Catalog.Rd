\item{OrthologsObject}{a matrix of lists, the upper triange of which is filled with matrices of putative homologs}
}
\description{
Catalog takes in an object of type `Orthologs` and builds a list of all complete linkage clusters. This list is in the form of matrices that denote how transitive the predicted clusters are.
